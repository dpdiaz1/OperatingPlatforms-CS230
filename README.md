# OperatingPlatforms-CS230
* Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?
  The Gaming Room is a client with a game called Draw it or Lose it, this game shows players pictures, the players must guess the picture or item correctly in order to win. If 
  players are unable to guess the picture correctly, other teams have one minute to make a guess and potentially win the game. The Gaming Room wanted to develop and transform 
  this game to be accessible in mobile devices, the task was to transform the web application and code into mobile device application accesible. Other requirements of the 
  project were unique names for each team, no duplicate games, a 200 high-definition image library, and the client's budget.

* What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?
  I believe I did well in the executive summary of the project. Including, requirements, design constraints, and the architectural view of the domain model.
  
* What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code?
  The design document is a great resource to reference back when developing a code because it allows developers to read and review in simpler language what the project 
 goals and requirements are. Personally, it helped me clear my vision whenever I became confused throughout the development process.
  
* If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?
  I would revise the comparisson between operating platforms and the development requirements for each playform.  I would research more information on the differences and 
  similarities between systems to be able to provide more details on each system.
  
* How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?
  This project provided clear expectations and understanding of the client's requirements for the project. It was clear that the goal was to create code for the game to be 
  accessible in mobile devices, I made sure the code would be able to check for duplicate games, and considered the memory and storage that would be adequate for the size of 
  the image library required for the game.
  
* How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?
  Learning about UML diagrams was interesting and I believe there is great benefit to using them in future developing processes. A UML diagram along with a design document can 
  be very helpful and act as a great guideline when developing code to be able to reference back and clear any confusion as the code is developed.
